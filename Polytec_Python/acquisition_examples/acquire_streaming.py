# This example script streams the acquired data directly of a device without any trigger handling (trigger options are
# only available in block mode). Note that data streaming data can lead to buffer overflows within the device when used
# with high bandwidths and/or a large number of active channels as the throughput might be limited by the bandwidth of
# your network connection.

# See print_config_options.py to determine your devices configuration options.
# See interactive_channel_selection.py to select the active acquisition channels.
# See interactive_bandwidth_and_range.py to select the bandwidth and ranges used for the data acquisition.
